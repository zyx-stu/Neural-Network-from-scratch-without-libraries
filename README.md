# Neural-Network-from-scratch-without-libraries
i am going to design a neural network from basic building blocks . Also , i am not going to use any pytorch or tensorflow or keras 
step 1 :- I used spiral data and used 3 classes 
step 2 :- Layers , Activation fucntions and Loss
          For all these 3 we will implement through Forward Pass and Backward Pass
